In thios repository you will find an approach from image processing to estimate dimensions form objects in a photo by comparing them with a known object. In first instance it may be an ARUco marker, however, it may be any other object of previously known size, such as a coin.

Feel free to use and modify the code, however, the algotithm is experimental and its use for critical or sensitive applications is not recommended and if used it's entirely your responsability (whoever forks this repo or uses the code in it).
